# Age And Gender Detection
To process this project I've used here OpenCv. This is the most popular library of Python. I've used here Google Colab. Colab supports many popular and high-level machine learning libraries which can be easily loaded. 

# Input & Output
I've taken 6 sample pictures. All the pictures are different catagories means all these are difference in age and gender.

# ScreenShots
